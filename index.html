                When I’m not coding, I love exploring the outdoors—whether it’s hiking through nature trails, swimming, or playing racquetball and badminton. Gardening allows me to unwind and appreciate growth in all its forms, just as I do in my academic and career pursuits. These activities fuel my creativity and help me maintain a balanced, healthy lifestyle.
